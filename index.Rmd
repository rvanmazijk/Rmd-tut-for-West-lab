# What is R Markdown?

R Markdown is a document preparation system, like MS Word, but completely different. Importantly, it works in plain-text and is highly accessible, open source, and makes it really easy to embed R-code in documents (e.g. to create figures or tables).

***

## Document preparation systems

Document prep systems vary. There are those where what you **see** is what you **get** in the final document ("WYSIWYG"-systems; e.g. MS Word), and there are those where what you **see** is what you **mean** ("WYSIWYM"-systems; e.g. markup languages such as HTML, LaTeX).

R Markdown is based on the markup language "Markdown". Mark**down** was invented to be a simpler alternative to more complicated mark**up** languages like HTML and LaTeX. These markup languafes are often quite hard to read in raw-form and even harder to write. See for yourself:

# The benefits of R Markdown

What R Markdown does is extend Markdown by making R-code (and other programming languages) executable from within the document's source file, allowing the results to show up in the final document (e.g. figures or tables), thereby "weav[ing] together narrative text and code to produce elegantly formatted output" (<https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>).

It also adds a bit more functionality to Markdown with simple syntax for in-text references, equations, and more.

And, best of all, it makes the results of any analysis fully reproducible!

# How does R Markdown work?

R Markdown takes the file you write (e.g. `analysis.Rmd`), converts it to plain markdown using the R-package `knitr`, then converts it any of the output formats you choose, using the open source software `pandoc`.

# Possible output formats

![](images/possible-output-formats.png)

***

An R Markdown (`.Rmd`) file has two main components:

1. the YAML header
2. and the body

# Example

`analysis.Rmd` might look like this:

---
title: My analysis
author: Ruan van Mazijk
date: 2019-11-15
output: html_document
---

# Introduction

Blah blah blah blah ...

# Methods

Etc. etc. etc. ...

***

## Rendering your document

Use the output specified in the header

    rmarkdown::render("analysis.Rmd")

Or over-ride it

    rmarkdown::render("analysis.Rmd"
      output_format = "pdf_document"
    )

***

## Using Markdown-style markup

***

### Headings

# A heading

## A sub-heading

### A sub-sub-heading

(Can go down 6 levels)

***

### Unordered lists
<!--A comment-->
<!--(won't get rendered in any of the final output(s))-->
```
